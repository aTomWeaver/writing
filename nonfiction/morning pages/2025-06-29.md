I've spent a good deal of this morning reading *Understanding Power*, a collection of interview-format talks that Noam gave in the late 80's and 90's and it has been incredibly eye opening. I don't know if it's because the publisher is British or what but there are many instances where Noam will refer to something offhand and the editor will briefly ellucidate what it is in brackets. It's incredibly useful and approachable.

Many historical events that Noam talks about are nearly completely unknown to me, shamefully. Although, I suppose it's hardly my fault for not knowing about things such as Iran-contra, the Cuban-Russian standoff and context behind the missle crisis, the fact that the My Lai massacre is pretty much insignificant in the context of all the other attrocities of the Vietnam War, etc. because these things just weren't taught to me. And for good reason, evidently; that's sort of the point of the chapter I suppose.

I finished chapter one this morning which deals with three subjects, broadly speaking: the effectiveness of protesting/dissent, government secrecy, and the media's narrow permissable viewpoints (i.e. the "propaganda model" from *Manufacturing Consent*.) From memory, the first argument was that protesting was/is effective in keeping the government from pursuing brazen, out-in-the-open violence; rather, it forces the government to pursue its interests more covertly
