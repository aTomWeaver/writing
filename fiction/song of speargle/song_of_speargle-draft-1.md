# Song of Speargle

The dim green light from the waybranch revealed the little bird in monochrome relief. Yet when Egon caressed the side, the feathers moved under his fingers like frail twigs. Blackvines covered the bird which sat crooked and motionless. Only the top half was visible. Egon removed the leather bag from his shoulder and pulled out a blade that was sheathed in the side. His machete lay at his feet where he had dropped it after hacking through the forest. Removing the bird would require more delicate work.

Ayla and Yegod stood behind Egon watching him work through the thick leather masks. It was nearly impossible to see anything outside the small radius of light cast by each of their waybranches, little branches with bioluminescence encapsulated in glass balls. Both were hung on little posts tied to their back. Egon's post was rammed into the ground so that he could work with both hands.

In truth, Yegod thought this expedition was a waste of time. He did not believe that forgotten gods would have any interest in their lot. Their planet had fallen to complete waste, an unliveable inferno. There was no way to know if others besides their own cave tribe yet survived but even if they did, there must have been less than 10,000 on the whole planet. Egon speculated that the geography of Hengenna may be more amenable to life, but there was no way to know for sure; a journey across the sea would be certain death.

While waiting for Egon to separate the bird from the vines, Ayla took off one of her gloves, slowly at first to see how he wrist would react to the heat, and gently touched the brimleaves hanging from the trees all around them. They were a purple so dark that they were nearly black with slighly lighter purple veins running through them. They were waxy to the touch and very wide. Each leaf was nearly the size of her hand. This expedition was her first outside of the cave. The party needed a normal scout, Egon, a ranger, Yegod, and someone from the Book Circle, herself. She was finally old enough to go outside the cave at 20, and her knowledge of the Historia made her ideal to lead them to Speargle.

Speargle's location was a part of the Apocrypha since no one had ever ventured out to confirm it. There was a real posibility of this expedition lasting days and ending with no discovery at all. Fortunately, the text had been mostly accurate and the party had found the little bird in two days. Ayla was grateful for this. She would not have been able to take a week out of the cave. She'd had to choke back vomit behind her mask when they were heading to a safe hole yesterday. The air was burning ammonia. It had taken them all night to make it to the safe hole and just thirty minutes of sunrise had felt like an eternity in perdition. As they ducked into the narrow ingress in the stone, Yegod pulled dried chey weed from a vile and put it in the metal sconce at the entrance and lit it aflame. Blue flames exploded from the sconce and quickly the air in the safe hole had been purified.

Egon reached the bottom of the bird, now freed from the vines and faced a new challenge.

"I can't pull it from its perch." He turned to Ayla. "Is there anything in the Apocrypha about this?"

"What is it grasping? Is it bone?"

Egon looked closer at the diry black perch.

"Looks that way," he said.

Ayla paused, uncertain. "It must be Thergot's finger."

"How do we get it off?" Egon said, impatiently.
