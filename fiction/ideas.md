- A bored banker has found it nearly impossible to sleep lately. He is consulting a couple on their new joint account (playing them the Chase video) when a car smashes through the side of the building and a group of guys get out and head up to the front counter to rob them. A couple of guys head to the vestibule to try and disconnect the ATM. The banker walks over to them and asks to come along. They make their exit and speed down the highway, weaving in and out of traffic as the banker finally drifts off to sleep.
